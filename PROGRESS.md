## Session: Environment & CI/CD Setup (Session 8)

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Status:** Paused — resuming at Step 4

### What was done

- Installed Firebase CLI (v14.11.0) via winget on Windows
- Ran `firebase init hosting` — linked to egc-church project
- Created two Firebase Hosting sites: `egc-staging777` (pre-prod), `egc-app777` (prod)
- Configured `firebase.json` multi-site config (staging + production targets)
- Updated `.firebaserc` with site target mappings
- Applied hosting targets via `firebase target:apply`
- Test deploy to `egc-staging777.web.app` succeeded (113 files)
- Fixed `/egc-church/` → `/` paths in `service-worker.js` (cache bumped v1 → v2) and `manifest.json`
- Confirmed `staging.egc.church` and `app.egc.church` already in Firebase authorised domains
- Renamed `AI_CONTEXT.md` → `CLAUDE.md` and committed
- All changes committed and pushed

### Architecture decisions made

| #   | Decision                                                                     | Rationale                                                                    |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Move hosting from GitHub Pages → Firebase Hosting (multi-site)               | Per-PR preview channels, CDN, official GH Action, SSL, same Firebase project |
| 2   | Hosting sites: `egc-staging777` (pre-prod) + `egc-app777` (prod)             | Clean environment separation; PR previews use auto-URLs                      |
| 3   | `main` = protected branch; merge = human approval gate                       | Nothing reaches prod without explicit reviewer action                        |
| 4   | Every prod release deploys static site + Firebase Functions together         | Keeps hosting and functions in sync                                          |
| 5   | DNS: only add `staging.egc.church` + `app.egc.church` subdomains now         | `www`/apex stay on AWS until full cutover decision is made                   |
| 6   | Fix `/egc-church/` → `/` in SW + manifest                                    | Firebase Hosting serves from root `/`, not a subpath                         |
| 7   | `AI_CONTEXT.md` renamed to `CLAUDE.md`                                       | Repo-aware agents auto-load `CLAUDE.md`                                      |
| 8   | CI gates: Firestore rules tests, HTML/link check, Lighthouse, SW cache check | All must pass before merge unlocks                                           |
| 9   | Firestore security rules tests are highest-value CI check                    | JS role checks are UX only; rules are real enforcement                       |

### Setup sequence status

- [x] Step 1 — Rename `AI_CONTEXT.md` → `CLAUDE.md`; keep `PROGRESS.md` committed
- [x] Step 2 — `firebase.json` multi-site config + `firebase init hosting`
- [x] Step 3 — Fix `/egc-church/` → `/` in `service-worker.js` and `manifest.json`; update authorised domains
- [ ] Step 4 — _(Human)_ Add custom domains in Firebase Console + DNS records at domains.co.za
- [ ] Step 5 — GitHub Actions: PR preview deploy + security-rules tests + link/Lighthouse/SW-cache checks; branch protection on `main`
- [ ] Step 6 — Firestore security-rules test scaffold
- [ ] Step 7 — Run Phase 1–5 build through this pipeline

### Notes

- `firebase-config.js` is gitignored — will be injected at deploy time via GitHub Actions secret
- Claude GitHub integration (`@claude` mentions in issues/PRs) confirmed working via `anthropics/claude-code-action`
- Long-term DNS cutover (repointing apex + www) deferred until new stack is trusted — one reversible change when ready

## Build Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation (current)

- [ ] Firestore security rules (all collections)
- [ ] Storage security rules
- [ ] Auth guard + role system (membership + adminRole)
- [ ] `js/admin-auth.js` — shared role-checking guard
- [ ] `js/member-auth.js` — shared membership-checking guard
- [ ] Email verification flow (Firebase Auth `sendEmailVerification`)
- [ ] Firebase Cloud Functions setup (`firebase init functions`)
- [ ] `onUserCreate` Cloud Function — auto-create `/users/{uid}` doc on registration
- [ ] `/admin/users.html` — approvals queue + role management (superadmin)
- [ ] `/admin/sermons.html` — add/edit sermons with YouTube URL + metadata
- [ ] `/sermons.html` — connected to Firestore (replace hardcoded data)
- [ ] `/profile.html` — user self-service (display name, photo, password, privacy toggles, resend verification email)
- [ ] Update service-worker.js cache list with new pages and bump cache version

### Phase 2 — Core Public Site

- [ ] `/events.html` — church calendar (public events) with cover images
- [ ] `/blog.html` — announcements with featured images
- [ ] `/connect.html` — visitor connect form
- [ ] `/about.html` — leadership team from Firestore
- [ ] `/gallery.html` — public gallery page
- [ ] `/music.html` — public music library (stream + download)
- [ ] `/admin/events.html`
- [ ] `/admin/blog.html`
- [ ] `/admin/team.html`
- [ ] `/admin/gallery.html` — manage galleries (with audience selector)
- [ ] `/admin/music.html` — upload and manage music tracks
- [ ] `/admin/connect.html` — view visitor connect form submissions
- [ ] Update service-worker.js cache list with new pages and bump cache version

### Phase 3 — Members Area

- [ ] `/members/live.html` — live stream (member-gated)
- [ ] `/members/prayer.html` — prayer request submission and listing
- [ ] `/members/groups.html` — browse and join groups, leader-only sections for managing own group
- [ ] `/members/directory.html` — membership directory (respects privacy flags)
- [ ] `/members/devotional.html` — daily devotional
- [ ] `/members/gallery.html` — members + youth galleries
- [ ] `/admin/prayer.html` — moderate prayer requests
- [ ] `/admin/groups.html` — full group management (editor/superadmin only)
- [ ] `/admin/devotional.html`
- [ ] Update service-worker.js cache list and bump cache version

### Phase 4 — Notifications & Messaging

- [ ] FCM token registration on login
- [ ] In-app notification bell (nav, real-time Firestore listener)
- [ ] `/admin/notifications.html` — compose and send broadcasts
- [ ] Cloud Function: `sendBroadcast` (HTTP/callable, FCM fan-out)
- [ ] Cloud Function: `onNewMessage` (Firestore trigger, DM push)
- [ ] Cloud Function: `onNewPrayerRequest` (Firestore trigger, alert fan-out)
- [ ] Cloud Function: `onNewConnectForm` (Firestore trigger, admin alert)
- [ ] Cloud Function: `weeklyDigest` (scheduled, Sunday)
- [ ] `/members/messages.html` — direct messaging between members

### Phase 5 — Polish

- [ ] Homepage dynamic content pulled from Firestore
- [ ] `/admin/homepage.html` — manage homepage content blocks
- [ ] Podcast RSS feed
- [ ] Cloudflare R2 or Internet Archive backup for sermon media
- [ ] Cloudflare R2 migration path for music if Firebase Storage approaches 5GB
- [ ] Cloud Function: `deleteUserAccount` (GDPR-compliant account deletion)
- [ ] Account deletion UI on `/profile.html`

## Architecture Decisions Log

### 2026-05-21 (Session 8) — CI/CD pipeline and Firebase Hosting migration

See session entry above.

### 2026-05-12 (Session 7) — Sanity fixes for consistency

- Added `"admins"` to the `/notifications/{notificationId}` audience enum
- Group leader permissions: leaders manage their own group from `/members/groups.html`, NOT `/admin/groups.html`
- Added `pendingMembers: [uid array]` field to /groups for "approval" joinPolicy flow
- Defined Firestore security rule pattern for groups
- Email verification edge case: /profile.html includes "resend verification email" for `emailVerified: false`
- Cloud Functions setup moved into Phase 1 (just `onUserCreate`)
- ENVIRONMENT.md rewritten with correct Cloud Functions timing and emulator instructions
- Service worker cache update task added to Phase 1
- /functions/ folder structure clarified: includes package.json and .eslintrc.js
- /team and /users explicitly noted as independent

### 2026-05-12 (Session 6) — Privacy, self-service, alert triggers, account deletion

- Added `/profile.html` for user self-service
- Added image fields to events (`imageUrl`) and blog (`imageUrl`) schemas
- Added `coverArtUrl` to music schema
- Member directory privacy: opt-out visibility, opt-in contact details
- Added directory privacy fields to /users: `directoryVisible`, `directoryShowEmail`, `directoryShowPhone`
- Added `phone` and `photoUrl` to /users schema
- Email verification required before member approval
- Group join policy: per-group `joinPolicy: "open" | "approval" | "invite-only"`
- Direct messaging: 1-on-1 initially, `participants` array allows group chat later
- Cloud Functions architecture expanded (onUserCreate, onNewMessage, onNewPrayerRequest, onNewConnectForm, sendBroadcast, weeklyDigest, deleteUserAccount)
- Account deletion: remove personal data, anonymise content authorship as "deleted-user"

### 2026-05-12 (Session 5) — Galleries, music, admin moderation pages

- Galleries: single `/gallery` collection with `audience` field ("public" | "members" | "youth")
- Youth gallery is member-gated (content tag, not a separate role)
- Music is fully public — stream and download, no login required
- Music categories: worship, choir, original, instrumental
- Added `/admin/connect.html` and `/admin/prayer.html`
- Gallery moved from Phase 5 to Phase 2

### 2026-05-12 (Session 4) — Full site architecture

- Role model: `membership` (content access) + `adminRole` (content management) — two independent dimensions
- Membership tiers: `pending`, `public`, `member`
- Admin roles: `null`, `editor`, `superadmin`
- New registrations default to `pending` — manual superadmin approval required
- Live stream restricted to `member` tier
- Sermon video via YouTube (youtubeId in Firestore) — not self-hosted
- Audio + PDFs in Firebase Storage
- YouTube thumbnail fetched client-side via public URL — no API key needed
- FCM confirmed for push notifications
- Firestore Security Rules are the enforcement layer — JS role checks are UX only
- `published` flag on all content types (draft workflow)
